      value: |
        This issue is especially welcoming for people who are new to contributing to the **Hiero C++ SDK**.

        We know that opening your first pull request can feel like a big step.  
        Issues labeled **Good First Issue** are designed to make that experience easier, clearer, and more comfortable.

        No prior knowledge of Hiero, Hedera, or distributed ledger technology is required.  
        Just a basic familiarity with C++ and Git is more than enough to get started.

        ## 🎯 Purpose of This Template

        This template is for suggesting issues that *might* be a good fit as  
        **[Good First Issues](docs/maintainers/guidelines-good-first-issues.md)** for the Hiero C++ SDK.

        If an issue involves more exploration or design choices, it may be a better
        fit for the **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, or **Advanced** labels.

        >
        > Good First Issues work best when they focus on **small, clearly defined changes** like:
        >
        > - Simple updates to existing `src` code (no behavior or API changes)  
        > - Light refactors, such as renaming variables or extracting helpers  
        > - Small, well-specified improvements to comments or documentation  
        > - Minor clarity improvements in examples or internal code  
        >
        > Tasks that involve broader changes — like modifying SDK behavior, working on
        > protocol logic, or touching many parts of the codebase — are usually a better
        > fit for **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, or **Advanced** labels.

        ## 👾 Description of the Issue — Example (C++)

        The file:

        ```src/sdk/main/src/TokenAssociateTransaction.cc```

        contains logic for building and initializing a `TokenAssociateTransaction`.

        The method `initFromSourceTransactionBody()` currently performs multiple responsibilities:
        - Validating that the transaction body contains token associate data
        - Extracting the account ID
        - Extracting and storing token IDs

        All of this logic is implemented inline in a single method, making it harder to read
        and more difficult for new contributors to understand the flow.

        The behavior is correct, but the structure could be improved for clarity and readability
        without changing any functionality.

        ## 💡 Proposed Solution — Example

        Refactor the `initFromSourceTransactionBody()` method by extracting
        clearly named private helper functions.

        The refactor should:
        - Preserve all existing behavior
        - Avoid modifying public APIs
        - Improve readability for new contributors
        - Remain confined to `TokenAssociateTransaction.cc`

        Please write out the end-to-end process for completing this issue from start to finish.

        The steps should clearly describe:
        - Where to begin  
        - Which files to open  
        - What to change  
        - How to make the change (e.g. what code to add, remove, or update)  
        - What the final result should look like  

        Clear, connected instructions help make the contribution experience smoother
        and more enjoyable for everyone.

        ### 👩‍💻 Implementation — Example

        To refactor `initFromSourceTransactionBody()`:

        - [ ] Identify the logic that:
          - Validates the transaction body
          - Extracts the account ID
          - Extracts token IDs
        - [ ] Extract each responsibility into a private helper method, such as:
          - `validateTokenAssociateBody(const proto::TransactionBody&)`
          - `extractAccountId(const proto::TokenAssociateTransactionBody&)`
          - `extractTokenIds(const proto::TokenAssociateTransactionBody&)`
        - [ ] Call the helper methods from `initFromSourceTransactionBody()`
        - [ ] Ensure no behavior changes occur
        - [ ] Build and run existing tests

        No new functionality should be introduced.
